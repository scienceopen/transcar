These are old ways to use the program, no longer maintained.


### Bash

This is the Mac/Linux only legacy way of running Transcar:

    ./run_beams_parallel.sh /tmp/tc

where `/tmp/tc` is the output directory.
Files are automatically erased, so be careful!



### Parallel remote execution

install the latest GNU Parallel into ~/bin by:

    wget -O - pi.dk/3 | bash
